# 🔤 Problem: Check if Two Strings Are Anagrams

## 📝 Description

Given two strings, determine whether they are **anagrams** of each other.

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using **all original letters exactly once**.

The comparison should be **case-sensitive** and should not ignore spaces or special characters unless explicitly mentioned.

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test Case 1
**Input:**  
`first = "listen"`  
`second = "silent"`

**Expected Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
Both words contain the same letters with the same frequency — **l, i, s, t, e, n**.

### Test Case 2
**Input:**  
`first = "hello"`  
`second = "bello"`

**Expected Output:**  
`false`

**Explanation:**  
The letter **'h'** in the first word and **'b'** in the second make them non-anagrams.
