# 🔍 Problem: Binary Search

## 📝 Description

Given a **sorted array** of integers and a **target value**, your task is to find the **index** of the target value using the **binary search algorithm**.

If the target value is not found in the array, return **-1**.

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search range in half, comparing the middle element with the target value, and adjusting the search boundaries accordingly.
